# Harmonize CS and OES orthographies
Python script to harmonize Church Slavonic and Old East Slavic (Old Russian) orthographic variants

Only use to flatten out major orthographic differences between the two early Slavic varieties, to carry out frequency analyses on mixed CS/OES datasets. The texts coming from each variety are assumed to be already normalized according to the variety-specific rules.

Free to modify the code by adding any desired change.
